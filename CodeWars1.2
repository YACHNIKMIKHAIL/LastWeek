1. Grasshopper - Messi Goals
Messi's Goal Total
Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions

var laLigaGoals=43;
var championsLeagueGoals=10;
var copaDelReyGoals=5;

var totalGoals=laLigaGoals+championsLeagueGoals+copaDelReyGoals;


2. String repeat
Write a function called repeatStr which repeats the given string string exactly n times.

function repeatStr (n, s) {
  let newString = ''
    while(n > 0) {
        newString += s
        n--
    }
    return newString
}


3. Is it even?
In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
The function needs to return either a true or false.
Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
Floats are considered UNeven for this kata.

function testEven(n) {
    if(n%2==0){
      return true;
    }else{
      return false;
    }
}


4. Grasshopper - Terminal game move function
erminal game move function
In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated by the die two times.
Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.

function move (position, roll) {
  return roll*2+position;
}


5. What's the real floor?
Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).
Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the floor in the european system.
With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor being removed, the numbers move down to take their place. 
In case of above 13, they move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.
Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.

function getRealFloor(n) {
  if(n<=0){
    return n;
  }else if(n>0&&n<13){
    return n-1;
  }else if(n>=13){
    return n-2;
  }
}

6. Reverse List Order
In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

function reverseList(list) {
return list.reverse()
}


7. You only need one - Beginner
You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.
Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.
Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

function check(a, x) {
  if(a.includes(x)){
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}


8. Transportation on vacation
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and 
your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.
Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, 
you get $20 off your total.
Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).


function rentalCarCost(d) {
  if(d>=7){
    return 40*d-50;
  }else if(d>=3){
    return d*40-20;
  }else{
    return d*40;
  }
}


9. Reversed sequence
Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.
Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

const reverseSeq = n => {
  let res=[];
  for(i=n;i>0;i--){
    res.push(i)
  }
  return res;
};


10. Expressions Matter
Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained

function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
  const results = [];
  results[0] = a * (b + c);
  results[1] = a * b * c;
  results[2] = a * b + c;
  results[3] = a + b * c;
  results[4] = (a + b) * c;
  results[5] = a + b + c;
  return Math.max(...results);
}
