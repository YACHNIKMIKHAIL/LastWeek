1.Powers of 2

Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

Examples
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]


function powersOfTwo(n){
 return Array.from({length: n + 1}, (v, k) => 2 ** k);
}




2.Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 1

The aspect ratio of an image describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Most video shown on the internet uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that for every pixel in the Y, there are roughly 1.77 pixels in the X (where 1.77 ~= 16/9). As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.

Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.

This kata is part of a series with Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 2 .

Example
374 Ã— 280 pixel image with a 4:3 aspect ratio.




function aspectRatio(x,y){
return [Math.ceil(y*16/9), y];
}
