1. Returning Strings
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

function greet(name){
  return ("Hello, "+name+" how are you doing today?")
}
    
    
2. Return Negative
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

function makeNegative(num) {
  if(num<=0){
    return num;
  }else{
    return num*-1;
  }
}


3. Opposite number
Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.

function opposite(number) {
  return number*-1;
}


4. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

function boolToWord( bool ){
  if(bool==true){
    return "Yes";
  }else(bool==false)
    return "No";
}


5. Convert a Number to a String!
We need a function that can transform a number into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?

function numberToString(num) {
  return String(num);
}


6. USD => CNY
Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY) . The input is the amount of USD as an integer, 
and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'

function usdcny(usd) {
  return (usd*6.75).toFixed(2)+" Chinese Yuan";
}


7. Convert a string to an array
Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words. For example:

function stringToArray(string){
	return string.split(" ");
}


8. Counting sheep...
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. 
We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  let count=0;
  for(let i=0;i<arrayOfSheep.length;i++){
    if(arrayOfSheep[i]===true){
      count++;
    }
  }
    return count;
}
