1.Parse nice int from char problem
Ask a small girl - "How old are you?". She always says strange things... Lets help her!

For correct answer program should return int from 0 to 9.

Assume test input string always valid and may look like "1 year old" or "5 years old", etc.. The first char is number only.

function getAge(inputString){
return  parseInt(inputString)
}




2.Drink about

Teens drink coke.
Young adults drink beer.
Adults drink whisky.
Make a function that receive age, and return what they drink.

function peopleWithAgeDrink(old) {
  if (old>=21)return "drink whisky";
  if (old<14)return"drink toddy"
  if (old<18)return"drink coke"
  if (old<21)return"drink beer"
};
