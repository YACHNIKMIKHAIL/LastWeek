1.Vowel remover
Create a function called shortcut to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

Examples
"hello"     -->  "hll"
"codewars"  -->  "cdwrs"
"goodbye"   -->  "gdby"
"HELLO"     -->  "HELLO"

function shortcut (string) {
  return string.replace(/[aeiou]/g,'')
}




2.Pirates!! Are the Cannons ready!??
If they aren't ready: Shiver me timbers!

Your gunners for each test case are 4 or less.

When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: aye or nay

Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)

If all answers are 'aye' then Fire! if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!



const cannonsReady = (gunners) => {
return  Object.values(gunners).every(response => response === 'aye')
    ? 'Fire!'
    : 'Shiver me timbers!'
}




3.get character from ASCII Value
Write a function get_char() / getChar() which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.

Example:

get_char(65)
should return:

'A'

function getChar(c){
  return String.fromCharCode(c)
}




4.Points of Reflection
"Point reflection" or "point symmetry" is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, 
Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.

Task
Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is a two-element array of integers representing the point's 
X and Y coordinates. Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.

function symmetricPoint([a, b], [c, d]) {
  return  [c * 2 - a, d * 2 - b]
}
