1.Volume of a Cuboid
Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: length, width and the height of the cuboid. 
Write a function to help Bob with this calculation.

class Kata {
  static getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {
    return length*width*height;
  }
}




2.Will there be enough space?
The Story:
Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. 
With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! 
He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:
cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
  let dif = Math.abs((cap - on)-wait)

return (on + wait < cap) ? 0: dif
}




3.Grasshopper - Messi goals function
Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:
LaLiga
Copa del Rey
Champions
Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.
Note: the input will always be valid.

function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
  return laLigaGoals+copaDelReyGoals+championsLeagueGoals;
}




4.Find the smallest integer in the array
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
For example:
Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

class SmallestIntegerFinder {
  findSmallestInt(args) {
    return Math.min(...args);
  }
}




5.Double Char
Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
doubleChar("String") ==> "SSttrriinngg"

function doubleChar(str) {
  var string = "";
  for( i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    string += str[i] + str[i];
  }
  return string;
}





6.Remove First and Last Character
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
 let z=str.split('');
  z.pop();
  z.shift();
return z.join('');
};




7.Find the Remainder
Task
Write a function that accepts two arguments and returns the remainder after dividing the larger number by the smaller number.
Division by zero should return NaN. (

function remainder(a, b){
 return (a > b ? a % b : b % a)
}




8.Is n divisible by x and y?
Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

function isDivisible(n, x, y) {
  return n % x === 0 && n % y === 0
}




9.Sum The Strings
Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

function sumStr(a,b) {
  return String(Number(a)+Number(b));
}




10.Is there a vowel in there?
Given an array of numbers, check if any of the numbers are the character codes for lower case vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
If they are, change the array value to a string of that vowel.
Return the resulting array.

function isVow(a){
 return a.map(
    charCode =>
      /[aeiou]/.test(String.fromCharCode(charCode))
        ? String.fromCharCode(charCode)
        : charCode)
}




11.Are You Playing Banjo?
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  if (/^[rR]/.test(name))return `${name} plays banjo`;
  return `${name} does not play banjo`;
}




12.Switch it Up!
When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words.
Input :: 1
Output :: "One".

function switchItUp(number){
if(number==1){
  return "One";
}else if(number==2){
  return "Two";
}else if(number==3){
  return "Three";
}else if(number==4){
  return "Four";
}else if(number==5){
  return "Five";
}else if(number==6){
  return "Six";
}else if(number==7){
  return "Seven";
}else if(number==8){
  return "Eight";
}else if(number==9){
  return "Nine";
}else{
  return "Zero"
}
}
