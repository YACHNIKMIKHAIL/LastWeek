1. MakeUpperCase
Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

function makeUpperCase(str) {
  return str.toUpperCase();
}




2. Enumerable Magic #25 - Take the First N Elements
Create a method take that accepts a list/array and a number n, and returns a list/array array of the first n elements from the list/array.
If you need help, here's a reference:

function take(arr, n) {
  return arr.slice(0,n);
}




3. Safen User Input Part I - htmlspecialchars
Safen User Input Part I - htmlspecialchars
You are a(n) novice/average/experienced/professional/world-famous Web Developer (choose one) 
who owns a(n) simple/clean/slick/beautiful/complicated/professional/business website (choose one or more) 
which contains form fields so visitors can send emails or leave a comment on your website with ease.
However, with ease comes danger. Every now and then, a hacker visits your website and attempts to compromise it through the use of XSS (Cross Site Scripting). 
This is done by injecting script tags into the website through form fields which may contain malicious code (e.g. a redirection 
to a malicious website that steals personal information).

Mission
Your mission is to implement a function that converts the following potentially harmful characters:

< --> &lt;
> --> &gt;
" --> &quot;
& --> &amp;
Good luck :D

Extension
If you are an experienced programmer, try shortening your code as much as possible and optimise it to minimise run time.
Experienced programmers should be able to complete this exercise in one line of code.

function htmlspecialchars(formData) {
   return formData.replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
                 .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
                 .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
                 .replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
}




4. Function 1 - hello world
Description:
Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".
Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of?
What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

const greet=()=>`hello world!`




5. Grasshopper - Debug sayHello
Debugging sayHello function
The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. 
It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:
Hello, Mr. Spock

function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`
}



6. How old will I be in 2099?
Your task is to write a function that takes two parameters: the year of birth and the year to count years in relation to. 
As Philip is getting more curious every day he may soon want to know how many years it was until he would be born, so your 
function needs to work with both dates in the future and in the past.

Provide output in this format: For dates in the future: "You are ... year(s) old." For dates in the past: 
"You will be born in ... year(s)." If the year of birth equals the year requested return: "You were born this very year!"

"..." are to be replaced by the number, followed and proceeded by a single space. Mind that you need to account for both 
"year" and "years", depending on the result.

Good Luck!

function  calculateAge(a,b) {
if (a>b&&+a-b==1){
  return `You will be born in ${+a-b} year.`
  }else if (a<b&&+b-a==1){
    return `You are ${b-a} year old.`
  }else if (a>b){
    return `You will be born in ${+a-b} years.`
  }else if (a<b) {
    return `You are ${b-a} years old.`}
  return 'You were born this very year!'
}






7. Hello, Name or World!
Define a method hello that returns "Hello, Name!" to a given name, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).

Assuming that name is a String and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Examples:

function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name? name[0].toUpperCase() +name.slice(1).toLowerCase():"World"}!`
}




8. Name on billboard
You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each letter has a default price of £30, 
but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.

You can not use multiplier "*" operator.

If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a letter).

function billboard(name, price = 30){
let cost=0;
  for (let i=0; i<name.length; i++){
    cost+=price;
  }
  return cost;
} 




9. All Star Code Challenge #18
This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

All Star Code Challenge #18

Create a function that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.


function strCount(str, letter){  
  return str.split(letter).length-1;
}




10. Short Long Short
Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside.
The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty ( zero length ).

Hint for R users:

The length of string is not always the same as the number of characters

function solution(a, b){
  if(a.length<b.length){
    return a+b+a;
  }else{
    return b+a+b;
  }
}
