1. Get Nth Even Number
Return the Nth Even Number

function nthEven(n){
  return(n*2)-2; 
}




2. Keep Hydrated!
Nathan loves cycling.
Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

function litres(time) {
  return Math.floor(time*0.5);
}




3. Beginner - Lost Without a Map
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.
For example:
[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

function maps(x){
return x.map(number=>number*2);
}




4. Remove First and Last Character Part Two
This is a spin off of my first kata.
You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.
Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character sequences except the first and the last ones but this time separated by spaces.
If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting string to be empty, 
return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).

Examples
"1,2,3"      =>  "2"
"1,2,3,4"    =>  "2 3"
"1,2,3,4,5"  =>  "2 3 4"
""     =>  NULL
"1"    =>  NULL

function array(arr){
return arr.split(',').slice(1,-1).join(' ')||null;

}





5. Did she say hallo?
You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?
Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.
These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

hello - english
ciao - italian
salut - french
hallo - german
hola - spanish
ahoj - czech republic
czesc - polish
Notes

you can assume the input is a string.
to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (Hallowen can pass the test)
function should be case insensitive to pass the tests

function validateHello(greetings) {
  res =/(hello|ciao|salut|hallo|hola|ahoj|czesc)/i.test(greetings) ;
  return res;
}




6. Hex to Decimal
Complete the function which converts hex number (given as a string) to a decimal number.

function hexToDec(hexString){
return parseInt(hexString,16)
}
