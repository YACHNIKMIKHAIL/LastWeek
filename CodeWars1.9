1. Jenny's secret message
Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. 
She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.
Can you help her?

function greet(name){
  if(name === "Johnny"){
    return "Hello, my love!";
  }
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}




2.The Feast of Many Beasts
All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same 
letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.
Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed 
to bring the dish to the feast.
Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, 
but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

function feast(beast, dish) {
if(beast[0]===dish[0]&&
  beast[beast.length-1]===dish[dish.length-1]){
  return true;
}
  return false;
}




3. Find Multiples of a Number
In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit .
If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0.
The limit will always be higher than the base.
For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.
If you can, try writing it in only one line of code.

function findMultiples(integer, limit) {
  const answ=[];
  for( let i=integer; i<=limit; i+=integer){
    answ.push(i);
  }
  return answ;
}
