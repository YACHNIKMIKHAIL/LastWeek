1.Holiday VIII - Duty Free
The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey you would have to buy such that the saving over the normal high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.

You will be given the high street price (normPrice), the duty free discount (discount) and the cost of the holiday.

For example, if a bottle cost Â£10 normally and the discount in duty free was 10%, you would save Â£1 per bottle. If your holiday cost Â£500, the answer you should return would be 500.

All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.

function dutyFree(normPrice, discount, hol){
return (Math.floor(hol/normPrice/discount*100))
}




2.Student's Final Grade
100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases
Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if(exam>90 || projects>10){
  return 100}
   if(exam>75 & projects>=5){
  return 90}
  if(exam>50 & projects>=2){
  return 75}
  
  return 0
}
