1. Name Shuffler
Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.

nameShuffler('john McClane'); => "McClane john"

function nameShuffler(str){
 return str.split(' ').reverse().join(' ')
}




2. Squash the bugs
Simple challenge - eliminate all bugs from the supplied code so that the code runs and outputs the expected value. Output should be the length of the longest word, as a number.

There will only be one 'longest' word.

function findLongest(str) {
 return Math.max(...str.split(' ').map(word=>word.length))
}




3. Keep up the hoop
Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

function hoopCount (n) {
   if(n>=10){
     return "Great, now move on to tricks";
   }   
  return "Keep at it until you get it";
}




4. Difference of Volumes of Cuboids
In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, 
representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

function findDifference([a,b,v], [g,d,e]) {
return Math.abs(a*b*v-g*d*e)
}




5. Can we divide it?
Your task is to create functionisDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by each out of two arguments.

A few cases:


(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false

(45, 1, 6)    ->  false
(45, 5, 15)   ->  true

function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
  return number%a===0&&number%b===0
}
