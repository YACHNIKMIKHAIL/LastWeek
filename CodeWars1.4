1.Sum of positive
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

function positiveSum(arr) {
  let answ=0;
  for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i]>0){
      answ+=arr[i];
    }
    }
    return answ;
  }
  



2.Basic Mathematical Operations
Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  if(operation=='+'){
    return value1+value2;
  }else if(operation=='-'){
    return value1-value2;
  }else if(operation=='*'){
    return value1*value2;
  }else(operation=='/')
    return value1/value2;
}




3.Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
Your task is to make two functions, max and min (maximum and minimum in PHP and Python, maxi and mini in Julia) 
that take a(n) array/vector of integers list as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array/vector.

var min = function(list){
return Math.min(...list);
}
var max = function(list){
return Math.max(...list);
}




4.Beginner Series #1 School Paperwork
Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.
Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

function paperwork(n, m) {
  if(n>0&&m>0){
    return n*m;
  }else{
    return 0;
  }
}





5.Century From Year
ntroduction
The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
Task
Given a year, return the century it is in.

function century(year) {
   let v = 0;
  while (year > 0){
    year = year - 100;
    v = v + 1;
  }
  return v;
}




6.Reversed Words
Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.

function reverseWords(str){
  return str.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');
}




7.Grasshopper - Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

var summation = function (num) {
  let s=0;
  for(let i=0; i<=num; i++){
    s+=i
  }
  return s;
}
