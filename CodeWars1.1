1. Opposites Attract
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  if(flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 === 0 || flower1 % 2 !== 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0){
    return false;
  }else{
    return true;
  }
}


2. Twice as old
Your function takes two arguments:
current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  let s=sonYearsOld*2-dadYearsOld;
  if (s>0){
 return s;
}else{
  return s*-1
}
  }
  
  
 3. Array plus array
  I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
 let arr = arr1.concat(arr2)
  let s=0;
   for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      s=s+ arr[i];
   }
   return s;
}


4. Third Angle of a Triangle
You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.
Write a function to return the 3rd.
Note: only positive integers will be tested.

function otherAngle(a, b) {
  return 180-a-b;
}


5. Even or Odd
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function even_or_odd(number) {
  if(number % 2 !== 0){
    return "Odd";
  }else{
    return "Even";
  }
}
