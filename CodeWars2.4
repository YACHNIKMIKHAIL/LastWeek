1.Square(n) Sum
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

function squareSum(numbers){
return numbers.reduce(function(sum, n){
    return (n*n) + sum;
  }, 0)
}




2.Is he gonna survive?
A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

const hero=(bullets, dragons)=>bullets/2>=dragons?true:false
