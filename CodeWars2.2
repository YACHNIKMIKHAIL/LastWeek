1.Beginner Series #2 Clock
Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000

function past(h, m, s){
  return ((h*3600)+(m*60)+s)*1000
}




2.For Twins: 2. Math operations
Task:
A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's width and height are equal, forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:

radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
  return 2 * radius * radius * (bottleLength - rimLength)
}
